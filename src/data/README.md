# Datasets

I have made 2 datasets one with 1M rows and one with 10M rows, all sampled from from HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-2 and HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu. They include 5 languages: Vietnamese, English, French, Japanese and Chinese. Each language have 200,000 rows in the 1M set and 2,000,000 rows in the 10M set. I also put in a small sample (50,000 rows in 1M set and 500,000 rows in 10M set) for validation
